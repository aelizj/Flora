    careGuide: "Here's a concise care guide:    1. Light:        Prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn an undesirable red or brown.    If indoors, place near a south or west-facing window but shielded from direct sun. If it doesn't receive enough light, it may begin to stretch out.    2. Water:        Water sparingly. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings.    In spring and summer, water every 3-4 weeks. In fall and winter, reduce to every 4-6 weeks.    Avoid letting water sit on the rosette as this can cause rot.    3. Soil:        Use a well-draining succulent or cactus mix.    Consider adding perlite or coarse sand to enhance drainage if needed.    4. Pot:        Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging and root rot.    5. Temperature and Humidity:        Ideal temperatures are between 65-80째F (18-27째C) during the day and a bit cooler at night.    While it can handle temperatures down to 40째F (5째C), it's best to avoid frost or freezing temperatures.    Humidity isn't a significant concern; the zebra plant is tolerant of a wide range.    6. Feeding:        During the growing season (spring and summer), feed with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks. Avoid over-fertilizing.    7. Propagation:        Easily propagated by offsets (baby plants) that grow at the base. Gently remove the offset and allow it to dry for a day or two before planting in a well-draining soil mix.    8. Pests and Diseases:        Generally disease-free, but be on the lookout for mealybugs, scale, and aphids.    Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure good drainage and water sparingly.    9. Pruning:        Generally not needed, but dead or damaged leaves can be removed for aesthetics and health.    Remember that individual plants might have slightly different needs depending on their environment. It's always a good idea to observe your plant and adjust care accordingly.",
